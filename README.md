## Links
* Source code repository: https://github.com/tdcosim/TDcoSim
* API Documentation:

## Installation
You can install the module directly from github with following commands:
```
git clone
cd
pip install -e .
```
## Using the module
The module can be imported as a normal python module:
```
import tdcosim
```
The following features are available currently:
1. Co-simulation with trasmission system defined in PSSE and distribution system defined in OpenDSS.
2. 
### Example: T&D co-simulation with 118 bus IEEE system
The following steps are required:
1. First import the following classes:
```
from from procedure.procedure import Procedure
```
